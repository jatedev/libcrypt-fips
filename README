# libcrypt implementation linked with OpenSSL FIPS

The is an implementation of libcrypt derived from eglibc 2.17. It
generates a shared libcrypt that links with a FIPS-compliant OpenSSL to
assist with STIG compliance.

It was developed in an Ubuntu 10.04 environment. The shared library
created is symbol compatible with GLIBC_2.0, and libcrypt.so.1. It can
be dropped into the appropriate multiarch directory and be picked up
with an ldconfig.

The test programs sha-test and cert (from eglibc) can be built.

Further needs to be done to make it more cross-platform aware.
Ultimately, it could be added as a feature to eglibc.


To assure FIPS compliance, the following C call must be done in
the application code. Any subsequent libcrypt calls will fail if
disallowed in FIPS mode.


if (!FIPS_mode_set(1))
  {
    ERR_load_crypto_strings();
    ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
    exit(1);
  }
else
  printf("*** IN FIPS MODE***\n");
